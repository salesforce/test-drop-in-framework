	 * and cache it. All following calls verify that the same interface and implementation
	 * is requested before returning the cached context class.
	 * <p>
	 * Please note: switching context during test execution may be fatal if information
	 * of previous context has been cached in calling classes. Therefore this method will
	 * prohibit any attempts to switch context.
